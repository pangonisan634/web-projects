<h1><strong>Quick Hummus Recipe</strong></h1>

<p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no mess. It has been adapted from a nu ber of different recipes that I have read over the years.<br> 
Hummus is a delicious thick paste commonly used in <em>Greek and Middle Eastern dishes</em>. It is very tasty with <em>salad, grilled meats and pita breads.</em></p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    1 can <mark>(400g)</mark> of chick peas <mark>(garbanzo beans)</mark>
    175g of tahini
    6 sundried tomatoes
    Half a red pepper
    A pinch of cayenne pepper
    1 clove of garlic
    A dash of olive oil
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.
    Add all the Ingredients into a food processor.
    Process all ingredients into a paste.
    If you want a coarse, "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.
</ol>

<p>For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely <em>throw it out.</em><br> 
Hummus can be frozen; you should thaw it and use it within a couple months.</p>
