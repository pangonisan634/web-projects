            <p>My purpose? How forward. But I'll tell I guess. My purpose, is to make sure things in this timeline don't go a-wall. 
                I'm more of a watcher than anything, which is why I spent my time in the himalayas. Though none of you really know what that place is besides the Hope of Humanity.
                Other than that, I don't limit myself at all. If anything, I'm only answering your questions because it'd make the timeline happy.
                That sounded confusing. Thing is, I made the timeline, so I'm technically doing whatever I want.
