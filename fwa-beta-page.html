        <p>The weeks leading up to the Pulse sent a lot of chaos through the entire planet. 
          There was nothing we could do to fight back against the Hivedroids, and I couldn't do anything because I was stuck having to get used to this new body of mine.
          I tried fighting him one time before the Pulse, but I got absolutely demolished. 
          But he kept me alive off of the possibility that I may be controlled by him one day, which made me shudder thinking about it. 
          But, now being the one controlling all of the Hivedroids, I can see where he's coming from. 
          I can find him in the Hive Mainframe, but I can't change him fundamentally since his protocol turned into an ideal for him, ever since he started actually feeling emotions way later on.
           But I digress. At the time, Beta-001 was the single most powerful weapon humanity has ever made in their 2 million year long existence. 
           We had nothing to counter the Beta and his forces anywhere around the world, besides me, but I mentioned that already. 
           But, how he was able to take the entire surface of the planet, is the real reason I'm here, talking to you, aren't I? 
           Well, there's a small thing more advanced Hivedroids like me, the Beta, and Legend are able to do, and it's to manipulate molecules.
          Mix and match the atoms of molecules that aren't part of an organic being, and transform it into the nanodrioids I'm made of.
           Well, I guess a little bit of all of us are made of nanodroids at this point. But anyways, that's how he did the pulse. He set off a shockwave of nanodroids from where he stood, spread it through the ground, and at that point, he could set off a chain reaction from one single spot, all over the world.
           That there, is what the Pulse was. A chain reaction around the world that hit everywhere apart from the oceans, lakes, rivers, you get me.</p>
